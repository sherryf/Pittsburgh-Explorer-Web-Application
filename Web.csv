Who knows, you might just find that Grist House Craft Brewery in Millvale, just minutes north of downtown Pittsburgh, becomes a home for you to catch up with old friends, make some new ones _ all whilst indulging in some delicious, locally brewed craft beer.The Who of Grist House Craft BreweryBefore getting into the aspects around the _whatÓ of Grist House Craft Brewery, letês start with the who. In our story, its Kyle Mientkiewicz and Brian Eaton, childhood friends from Erie, PA, brothers-in-law (yes, Kyle approved of Brian marrying his sister), brewers extraordinaire and all-around good dudes.2007-2012: The Home Brew StageYep, you guessed it.  Our craft brewing story starts off like everyone elseês _ in our homes brewing only 5 or 10 gallons at a time.2012:After years of home brewing and honing their craft, Kyle and Brian got the idea that maybe€ just maybe€ people (outside their immediate family and college buddies) would enjoy drinking their beers as much as they did. As they say, the proverbial light bulbs lit up, the planets aligned and the idea of Grist House Craft Brewery was born.Well€ not really the end of the story, itês actually just the beginning. If you know Kyle or Brian (next time you stop by the brewery, be sure to ask to meet ¥em, theyêd love to meet you) once they get onto an idea they are passionate about, theyêll make it happen come hell or high water.2014Armed with a passion for great, locally made craft beer and the desire to introduce as many people as possible to said beer, Kyle and Brian set forth bringing their dream to fruition.  After countless forms, hunting for property, remodeling an old slaughterhouse into a brewery, and installing equipment, they finally opened Grist House Craft Breweryês doors Memorial Day weekend 2014.If you want the nitty-gritty details of what it takes to open a craft brewery, stop in for a pint and a member of our Grist House family (most likely Kyle or Brian) will regal you with everything you want to know. Besides, isnêt story telling always more enjoyable with a cold beer in your hand?In the meantime, know this: everyone at Grist House Craft Brewery has a deep passion for craft beer and the people who drink it.

They are unusual bridges due to the fact that instead of having cables, they use eye-bars. This gives them quite a different appearance from the average cable suspension bridge. Stiffening for the bridge is accomplished by through plate girders. They were the first examples of self-anchored suspension bridges, meaning the eyebars tie into the the stiffening girders, but not to any anchorages. The bridge has a 430 Feet (292.6 Meters) span between towers, 960 Feet (11.6 Meters) total suspended length, and 39.7 Feet (12.1 Meters) of navigation vertical clearance. The listed Minimum Vertical Underclearance is 14.3 Feet (4.36 Meters) Over Highway.The bridge apparently sometimes closes to vehicular traffic during games at PNC Park, allowing pedestrians to walk on the vehicular roadway.

After the British abandoned the fort in 1772, the Block House turned into a trading post for a number of years. By 1785, the building was converted into a single family dwelling. During the 19th century it became a multi-family tenement with a family living on the second floor.In 1894, the Block House was gifted to the Pittsburgh Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution by the structureês owner, Mary Croghan Schenley. The chapter embarked upon a 16-month restoration, which primarily involved the in-filling of window and door openings cut into the Block House during its century-long use as a residence.The Block House is still owned and operated by the Fort Pitt Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. It has remained free and open to the public since 1895.

The first, Allegheny Market House on the North Side (pictured above), began operations in 1863. The building was modernized and renovated, but a portion of the market house was damaged by fire in 1944. The building was demolished in 1965 to make way for an apartment high rise and shopping mall in Allegheny Center.The South Side Market House opened in 1893. Owned by the city, the market became a financial drain and was closed in 1943. When the building was threatened with demolition in the 1970ês, South Side residents and the Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation campaigned to save it and the South Side Market House was transformed into the South Side Recreation Center.The East Liberty Market House was built in 1900, but was unsuccessful and was sold to the Pittsburgh Automobile Association for its auto shows in 1915. Through the 1920ês the building was also used for sporting events and it became a car dealership in the 1940ês. In 1988 the building was bought by AAA and redesigned as an upscale shopping mall. The retail mall failed, but AAA expanded to occupy the building, along with other professional office space.Market Square was created in 1764 as Pittsburghês first business and shopping district. Often a market house sat on this site, most significantly the Diamond Market from 1914 to 1961 when it was demolished. Another venture, Market on the Square, a meat and food market attached to G.C. Murphyês was closed in 1994.Holiday HoursPPM vendors are_open Monday to_Friday 10am-7pm_and_Saturday & Sunday 9am-5pm_until January 3.

Our most lasting and well-known symbol is the Allegheny County Courthouse and Jail complex, originally designed in 1883 by Boston architect Henry Hobson Richardson, and built between 1884-1888.These internationally recognized historic structures reflect Hobson's stature as one the greatest architects in the history of American architecture, and continue to draw visitors from throughout the world who marvel at the buildings' simple style, dignity and strength.The current courthouse is actually the third in the history of Allegheny County. The first permanent Pittsburgh Courthouse was built in the area now known as Market Square. It was replaced in 1841 by a grand building in the Greek Revival style. This courthouse was built on Grant's Hill, on the site of the present courthouse.On May 7, 1882, a fire broke out in the rotunda of the second Allegheny County Courthouse, destroying the building. Soon after, county commissioners sent letters to one hundred American architects, asking them to submit designs for a new Allegheny County Courthouse. On January 31, 1884, Richardson was officially chosen to design Allegheny County's new courthouse.Richardson's design was chosen because of its clarity of design and organization. He said he designed the buildings, ""to express in the exterior the character and purpose of the interior, and to rely for architectural effect upon the arrangement of the messes, and the dignity and solidity of the construction.""Construction on the Courthouse and jail complex began in 1884. Work on the jail was completed in 1886. The courthouse was completed in 1888, Unfortunately, Richardson did not live to see his masterpiece completed. He died in 1886.The architecture is characterized by the classic symmetry of the Renaissance, with Romanesque details, including Syrian      arches, Byzantine Capitals, late French Gothic dormer windows and French Renaissance roofs. Among the most impressive features of the courthouse and jail are the Courthouse tower, rising more than 229 feet; the solemn mass of the jail; the picturesque silhouettes of the roof lines, towers and turrets; the soaring arches and dignified columns; and the practical arrangements of windows, which provide an abundance of natural light.Although there have been innumerable alterations to both the courthouse and jail over the years, these impressive buildings have withstood the test of time and remain powerfully expressive structures enjoyed as architectural masterpieces.The jail, which was officially closed in 1995, has been masterfully converted into a new combined home of the juvenile and family sections of the Common Pleas Court. The restored and readapted facility has won many national and international design awards.",0

Maggieês Farm is an independent craft distillery founded without the support of banks, venture capitalists, and rich relatives.All of our rums are distilled from turbinado, a raw cane, rather than molasses and pot-distilled for body and flavor on 100% copper Spanish-made stills. All of our aged rums are now pushing two years old and aged in neutral rum casks, same as most Caribbean distillers do, to preserve the flavors and aromas produced by tertiary esterification, rather than the oaky flavors produced by new charred or ex-whiskey casks used by most American craft rum distillers.

Bowman became the University's 10th chancellor in 1921. In those years following World War I, student enrollment had dramatically increased, causing a critical shortage of space. A 14-acre plot known as Frick Acres, which housed residences, gardens, and tennis courts, became the focus of Dr. Bowman's plans to erect a monumental building. A structure expanding upward, though unorthodox, would solve the growing University's problems of space and distance. More important, a tower would be a visible inspiration to all who approached the city. It would carry the message that education was the result of aspiring to great heights. The parallel lines of the truncated Gothic form, never meeting, would imply that learning is unending. The sweeping proportions would symbolize the spirit and achievement of Pittsburgh.  Architect Charles Z. Klauder translated these concepts into drawings that guided the placement of steel and stone.",0

They visited the Hungarian version of the Escape Room where they were instantly hooked, returning later that day to take on the second room.

Who knows, you might just find that Grist House Craft Brewery in Millvale, just minutes north of downtown Pittsburgh, becomes a home for you to catch up with old friends, make some new ones _ all whilst indulging in some delicious, locally brewed craft beer.The Who of Grist House Craft BreweryBefore getting into the aspects around the _whatÓ of Grist House Craft Brewery, letês start with the who. In our story, its Kyle Mientkiewicz and Brian Eaton, childhood friends from Erie, PA, brothers-in-law (yes, Kyle approved of Brian marrying his sister), brewers extraordinaire and all-around good dudes.2007-2012: The Home Brew StageYep, you guessed it.  Our craft brewing story starts off like everyone elseês _ in our homes brewing only 5 or 10 gallons at a time.2012:After years of home brewing and honing their craft, Kyle and Brian got the idea that maybe€ just maybe€ people (outside their immediate family and college buddies) would enjoy drinking their beers as much as they did. As they say, the proverbial light bulbs lit up, the planets aligned and the idea of Grist House Craft Brewery was born.Well€ not really the end of the story, itês actually just the beginning. If you know Kyle or Brian (next time you stop by the brewery, be sure to ask to meet ¥em, theyêd love to meet you) once they get onto an idea they are passionate about, theyêll make it happen come hell or high water.2014Armed with a passion for great, locally made craft beer and the desire to introduce as many people as possible to said beer, Kyle and Brian set forth bringing their dream to fruition.  After countless forms, hunting for property, remodeling an old slaughterhouse into a brewery, and installing equipment, they finally opened Grist House Craft Breweryês doors Memorial Day weekend 2014.If you want the nitty-gritty details of what it takes to open a craft brewery, stop in for a pint and a member of our Grist House family (most likely Kyle or Brian) will regal you with everything you want to know. Besides, isnêt story telling always more enjoyable with a cold beer in your hand?In the meantime, know this: everyone at Grist House Craft Brewery has a deep passion for craft beer and the people who drink it.  Our goal is to bring the great people of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania quality beers brewed to our highest standards. We are proud of every beer we brew and every draught we pour.Whether you prefer a full-body IPA, refreshing wheat, crisp Kolsh or a hearty imperial stout, we believe we grind out great beers that you (and your friends) will truly enjoy.We look forward to you visiting our house and beer garden (or _biergartenÓ)€ weêll be sure to make you feel at home.Cheers / Na zdrowie / Slainte,The Grist House Family",10

The first is the museum, home to Johnnyês collection of memorabilia spanning his 50+ years in the music business, and the second is his store, selling an impressive collection of products, musical instruments, and more.Much like neighboring Bicycle Heaven or nearby Randyland, the museum at Johnny Angelês Ginchy Stuff is nothing short of impressive and has more items on display than you can really appreciate in just one visit. There are signed records from bands Johnnyês played with, themed jackets from shows and various bands, photos with other celebrities, playbills from performances, and so much more to be found that were picked up over the years.Even the restrooms are decorated from floor to ceiling with favorites from Johnnyês collection! (ask Johnny to show you where they are, theyêre not marked.)One of my favorites was not so much a music piece itself, but instead was a typed break-up letter from a one-time (presumably high school) sweetheart of Johnnyês during his early years where the girl broke up with him to run off to a convent and become a nun. But donêt feel too bad for him, she loved his car, music,_attitude, and assuredly would think of him often- hitting on just about every cliche of the time in glorious fashion.Judging from Johnny now, based on my extremely limited interaction at the store, heês not too heartbroken by the one that got away.A Music Store for Serious (and Not-So-Serious) CollectorsThe second half of Johnny Angelês Ginchy Stuff is a music store that features everything from musical instruments, decorations, toys (anyone in the market for a fully articulated Freddy Mercury?), cassettes, CDs, and records to name a few.When I met with Johnny at the store we spent some time talking about records and he excitedly ushered me over to his collection to share some of his favorites as well as others that are incredibly rare and worth hundreds, if not thousands of dollars. (So record collectors take note- this is an untouched gem to go visit now.)The real shock to me was that the bulk of the collection for sale at Johnnyês is just a fraction of the records he owns in his $500,000+ collection, and most of the ones that are on sale are duplicates that have never been played- the rare ones included.Overall, Johnny Angelês Ginchy Stuff is a fantastic store to have in the North Side, and its new location is perfect for those who enjoy the offbeat. So next time you visit the North Side, you would be wise to head on over to Columbus Avenue to_pay Johnny a visit. You wonêt regret it.",0

In a time when most people walked to work, homes quickly filled in the areas surrounding these industries and the need for additional housing within a short distance of their work caused people to begin living atop nearby Mount Washington. Steep paths were the only quick means of travel between the mountainês top and the river flats below. Despite plenty of available land for housing, development of Mount Washington lagged due to a lack of good roads and public transportation until the predominantly German immigrants of Coal Hill _ as Mount Washington was then known _ proposed the construction of several inclines similar to ones already operating in their native land.Built at a cost of $50,000, the incline opened up Mount Washington to development, enabling people to live 600 feet above the city and still have easy access to factories and businesses along the river.The Mon Incline was consolidated into Port Authority operations in 1964 and declared a historic structure by the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation in 1970.Since then, Port Authority has made a number of renovations to ensure this historic mode of transit is enjoyed for years to come. Today, more than 1,500 riders use the Mon Incline on an average weekday, with that number nearly doubling for Saturday sightseeing. Mon Incline Facts:   * Length:_635 feet* Elevation:_367.39 feet* Grade:_35 degrees, 35 minutes* Speed:_6 miles per hour* Passenger Capacity:_23 per car* Opened:_May 28, 1870* Renovation History:      * 1882: Steel structure    * 1935: Electrical equipment replaced steam engines    * 1982-83: Structure, lower station and cars rehabilitated    * 1994: Upper station restored; electrical, motor and braking systems rebuilt; cars made wheelchair accessible; trackway lighting installed * Fares:     * Cash, ConnectCard,_passes and ConnecTix_are accepted as payment on the Monongahela Incline.

In the traditional Italian village of Trabia, Sicily there were three brothers of the proud, hard working Sunseri family who wanted to open an Italian food shop and bring their admirable work ethic to America. In 1902, Augustino, Salvatore and Michael Sunseri formed the company that is now known as the Pennsylvania Macaroni Company. They started out by manufacturing pasta and it was not easy, as it never is. But after going through the normal growing pains of starting out, things started to look up. _Even a devastating fire that might have knocked the life and determination out of many did not stop the Sunseri brothers.From an Italian Pasta Shop to an Italian Imports ShopWith incredible guts and will, they rebuilt the store and soon pasta manufacturing blossomed into olive oil and spice retailing along with offering specialty food products and Italian cheeses. The companyês nucleus was formed and in the late 1940's, Augustino's sons, Robert (Uncle Bob) and Salvatore took the reins. At this point, Uncle Bob and Salvatore could see todayês phenomenal success begin to develop.A Modern Italian Food StoreDo blood, sweat and tears pay off? The stories of the Sunseri family and of the Pennsylvania Macaroni Company are classic examples of all that hard work and dedication can accomplish. Today, Pennsylvania Macaroni Company is one of the premiere Italian specialty food operations in the country. We stock over 5,000 specialty products.The third generation of the Sunseri family is now at the wheel and when you visit our legendary location in the ""Strip District"" of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, you will see that behind every great company are great people. Our family is easily accessible and will bend over backwards to show you how much we value your business.Our Online StoreTo keep on track with our history of exceptional commitment to customers, our website www.pennmac.com offers you the convenience of shopping from your home or work and provides some of Pennsylvania Macaroni Companyês best products, including our famous Italian cheeses. But, nothing takes the place of visiting the Penn Mac tradition in person. Go to 2010-12 Penn Avenue in Pittsburghês ""Strip District"" and experience this legendary Italian tradition for yourself!Retail store hoursSundays 9:00 AM- 2:30 PMMonday thru Saturday 6:30 AM - 4:30 PM",30
